# Successful Negotiation: Essential Strategies and Skills

# 📍 Plan Your Negotiation Strategy

## 🔷 Should I negotiate?

- 成本 vs 好處
    - 教授 offer 範例

        大學發給教授offer，教授回信附帶一些條件，結果大學把offer取消了。

## 🔷 Position Based vs Interest  Based

[✳️ Types of Negotiations](https://www.notion.so/ef3a36f953cf44b3834e5bf7657e4dd1)

- 有人認為大部分時候，去尋找 Interest-Based 只是在浪費時間，但教授推薦我們，無論如何，都試著去尋找 bigger pie，創造更多價值。
- 永遠要做好 Position-Based 的準備。
- Pizza 範例

    Position Based：一人一半，一般認為這就是 win-win

    Interest Based：一人喜歡邊邊，另一人喜歡料，雙方可得想要的部分，真正的 win-win

## 🔷 Six types of dispute resolution & Three lenses

1. Power（武力）
2. litigation（訴訟）
3. arbitration（仲裁）
4. mediation（調解）
5. negotiation（談判）
6. avoidance（迴避）

### 🔶 Alternative Dispute Resolution（ADR）

✳️ Litigation is the enemy! Avoid litigation.

- Arbitration、Mediation、Negotiation

### 🔶 Third Party Processes

✳️ External Third Parties or Third Parties within a Business（External & Internal）

- Litigation、Arbitration、Mediation

### 🔶 Power Rights Interests

✳️ Who's right? Which is finding underlying interests of both parties?

- Power：Power
- Rights：Litigation、Arbitration
- Interests：Mediation、negotiation

### 🔶 Conclusion

- Search for interests - even in a dispute resolution negotiation
- Understand the six types of dispute resolution and the three lenses
- Consider using dispute resolution processes like mediation and arbitration for deal making

## 🔷 How should I analyze a negotiation?

1. What questions should I ask to complete an analysis?
2. What is my BATNA in a dispute resolution negotiation?
3. How can I use decision trees to complete my BATNA analysis?

> "If you don't know where you're going, you might end up somewhere else."  
  *——  Yogi Berra*

✳️ 狀況：

- 我想要賣車，Sarah 是唯一一個回應我的買家
- 我需要賣至少 $4000，因為我要付新車的錢
- 我需要三週後再交車
- 做足功課後，合理價格為 $5000
- 這筆交易至少要賣$4500，不然我就用 $4000 賣給我的朋友，而且他會讓我三週後再交車

### 🔶 What's the Other Side's Analysis?

- One of the landmarks of successful negotiators. They always look at the deal from the perspective from the other side.

### 🔶 Key Questions in a Negotiation Analysis

1. What is your overall goal in reaching a negotiated agreement with Sarah?
2. What issues are most important to you in reaching this goal? Why are these issues important?
3. **What is your Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement(BATNA) with Sarah?**
4. What is your reservation price ( in this negotiation with Sarah, the lowest price that you will accept)?
5. What is your most likely price?
6. What is your stretch goal?

### 🔶 Conclusion

- Setting a large stretch goal can close a great deal but don't be too greedy.
- BATNA
- What's the other side's analysis?
- Where is the ZOPA (Zone of Potential Agreement)?

## 🔷 BATNA in a Dispute Resolution Negotiation

✳️ 如果無法自行談判或調解，通常 BATNA 就是 litigation。

### 🔶 Things about Litigation in US

- Contingency Fees: 
律師抽金額%數。
- Class Actions: 
可以多人聯合控告。
- Discovery: 
1. 律師可以自己去調查公司、個人文件，並呈堂供證。
2. 可以要求對方在法院見證人下發誓作證。
- Jury Trials: 
在民事訴訟也會有，例如商業訴訟。
- Punitive Damages: 
懲罰性賠償，為防止其他人也從事相似事項。且在美國這筆費用會給原告。
- "American Rule" (on attorney fees):
輸家不用付贏家的律師費。
- 要進入美國司法系統是很容易的。
- 車禍例子
    - 車速過快，擦撞後椅子擠壓造成小孩死亡。
    - 父母控告：椅子有問題，沒有警告我們椅子危險，而且要求懲罰性賠償（魯莽行為）。
    - 車商回應：椅子有達到產業標準，而且也超過政府標準。
    - 父母律師 "Discovery" 發現車商早就知道有問題，且一直隱瞞大眾，產品直接上線
    - 最後結果：賠償＋懲罰性賠償

### 🔶 Conclusion

- If you cannot negotiate the settlement of a dispute either directly or with the help of a mediator, your BATNA might be litigation (or arbitration, which is basically private litigation).
- To analyze your litigation BATNA, especially in a global economy, you should understand the basic elements in the litigation process.

## 🔷 Using Decision Tree to Complete Your BATNA Analysis

- 範例
    - A控告B，要求 4.6 million，五十趴贏，如果輸了要付＄400,000
    - B提供 2 million 要和解。

    提問：是否要和解？

    - 解答

        ![Successful%20Negotiation%20Essential%20Strategies%20and%20Sk%20935fc694db3c41389a940c02f5be67d9/Screen_Shot_2021-02-27_at_2.54.47_PM.png](Successful%20Negotiation%20Essential%20Strategies%20and%20Sk%20935fc694db3c41389a940c02f5be67d9/Screen_Shot_2021-02-27_at_2.54.47_PM.png)

### 🔶 Conclusion

- Decision trees are valuable tools for analyzing your BATNA in both dispute resolution and deal-making negotiations.
- This tool is also useful in making other complex business decisions.

## 🔷 Cross-Cultural Negotiations

- In cross-cultural negotiations, do a gap analysis to identify how your negotiation style differs from the other side.
- Keep in mind that there are variances within each culture.
- Conduct research so that you can avoid actions that are offensive in the other culture.
- Try role-reversal.
- Success of negotiation between cross-national companies depends on respect of each other rather than style.

## 🔷 Ethical Issues and Standards

### 🔶 Law-Based Ethical Standards

- Fraud: False representation of a material fact that is relied on by the other side
- Fiduciary Duty: A high duty of trust and loyalty
- Unconscionability: Violates principles of good conscience

### 🔶 General Ethical Standards

- Organizational Standards
- Mentor: Someone you admire
- Personal Standards: Gut Test, Newspaper Test, Family Test, Golden Rule

## 🔷 Use Agent for negotiation or not?

- Is the agent a better negotiator?
- Does the agent have more experience in negotiating the issues?
- Does the negotiation involve a technical matter that requires the expertise of an agent?
- How much time do I have to invest in a negotiation?
- What is my relationship with the other side?

### 🔶 Reality

- In business, almost all negotiations are conducted through agents.
- Sometimes companies use secret agents since they don't want other side to know who's behind.

    ![Successful%20Negotiation%20Essential%20Strategies%20and%20Sk%20935fc694db3c41389a940c02f5be67d9/Screen_Shot_2021-03-01_at_11.51.51_AM.png](Successful%20Negotiation%20Essential%20Strategies%20and%20Sk%20935fc694db3c41389a940c02f5be67d9/Screen_Shot_2021-03-01_at_11.51.51_AM.png)

    - 華特迪士尼例子
        - 他用迪士尼的名字在 LA 買了 80 acres，結果周圍的地區被其他人買走，他發誓再也不這麼做。
        - 之後他跑到 Florida，設置 dummy cooperation 等等，用 secret agent 買了 2700 acres。

### 🔶 First question to ask before starting negotiate with an agent

- Agent's Authority
    - Express: authority to negotiate the deal
    - Implied: authority to negotiate certain deal
    - Apparent: company said agent has, but it doesn't
    - 向銀行借錢實例
        - A 向銀行借錢，但他沒有抵押品。
        - A 在大公司上班，他請主管 B 保證公司能還錢，且附上簽名。

        問題：思考銀行是否要借錢？

        - 結果
            - 銀行借了錢，A 卻違約。
            - 銀行向公司討債，但法院判定公司沒有義務要付錢，因沒有授權 B 保證還錢。

> **Do not assume that the other side has full authority just because they are there negotiating with you...** Before starting on any give-and-take, find out about the authority on the other side. It is perfectly legitimate to inquire, "Just how much authority do you have in this particular negotiation?" *—— Getting to Yes*

👆 *Instead of asking other side directly, you should ask the principal.*

### 🔶 Conclusion

- Use the factor checklist when deciding whether to use an agent during negotiations.
- At the beginning of every negotiation, find out whether your counterpart has authority to make a deal.

---

# 📍 Use Key Tactics for Success

## 🔷 Getting to Know the Other Side

- Avoid your favorite topic - or else you'll probably talk too much.
- Ask a lot of questions. People love to talk about themselves and often will think you are a great conversationalist if you talk about them...
- Listening is crucial. Dan, a comedian from Manhattan, has learned to summarize what the other person says. ("So you think that..." or "So what you're saying is...") "A conversation can go on indefinitely if you do this" he says.

## 🔷 Using Power in Negotiations

✳️ **BATNA = Power**

1. 找出對方的 BATNA
    - 要跟對方說自己的 BATNA 嗎？

        看狀況，如果自己的 BATNA 很弱，那就不要讓對方知道；如果很強，那就要讓對方知道。

2. 削弱對方的 BATNA
    - 對方有很強的 BATNA 怎麼辦？如何削弱對方的 BATNA？

        可以強調差異性，強調自己的品質、可靠。

3. 增強自己的 BATNA

    > "You would never do a deal without talking to anyone else. Never."

- Also, forming a coalition is another very powerful form of negotiation.

### 🔶 Use Psychological Tools to avoid traps

✳️ Traps: 

1. Mythical Fixed Pie Assumption: We assume that our interests are in direct conflict with the interests of the other side.
    - *Reactive devaluation - 先入為主的貶低*
    - 範例
        - 教授在課堂上請同學兩兩一組，在十秒內掰手腕，若一方掰到底則得一分，最後看比數分配
        - 大部分同學比數為 2 vs 1、3 vs 3
        - 但有少部分同學的比數為 15 vs 15、20 vs 20
        - 少部分同學了解兩邊的利益並沒有衝突，而選擇合作

    ***** 要注意不要讓自己陷入競爭的思維 ***

2. Anchoring: We anchor on an initial value when estimating the value of uncertain objects.
    - Conventional wisdom: 讓對方先丟出價錢因為我們也不確定真正的價值。
    - Anchoring: 自己先丟出價錢，可產生錨定現象。
    - 到底要不要先提出offer？

        當我們很確定自己的價值的時候，可以先提出來。反之當我們不確定價值時，讓對方先提。

    - 若兩邊都很聰明，都不先提出offer呢？

        可訴諸 information exchange。比如律師在談判時，兩邊會找類似案件的offer，慢慢形成共識。

3. Overconfidence: We are overconfident that our judgements are correct.
    - 相信一件事的好處 vs 過度自信的壞處
        - 創業家的 Overconfidence 常常能提供 vision 來說服員工和投資者，正向思考讓他們看見人們最好的一面，並使他們貢獻自己的力量。
        - 人們因過度自信，而做很多錯誤的決定。比如說股市交易員會頻繁交易，但長遠來看卻是虧錢的；又比如談判時在尋找 ZOPA，因過度自信受到限制，而無法找到共識。
        - **我們應該要根據狀況來判斷自信與否。**
            - Decision making - Realist, Disconfirming Evidence
            - Decision Implementation - Optimist
    - 人很難去專注在 disconfirming evidence，我們都受到 confirming evidence 的吸引。
    - "Many great leaders are the ones who are surrounded by people who challenge their thinking and test their thinking, rather than people who simply agree with whatever the leader proposes."
4. Framing: The way that options are framed cause us to be risk averse (if positive frame) or risk seeking (if negative frame).
    - 描述會影響人的選擇。
    - 若要人付出，人傾向賭賭看，不付出；若要人接受好處，人傾向不賭，選擇保險一點的選項。
    - 診所範例

        有600人等著被治療，有不同方案可以選擇。

        - A方案：200人會被治療。
        - B方案：1/3的機會所有人會被治療，但有2/3的機會所有人沒辦法被治療。

        *👆 在這個狀況下，大多數人選擇 A。正面的 framing 讓人傾向不要風險。*

        - C方案：400人會死掉。
        - D方案：1/3的機會沒有人會死掉，但有2/3的機會所有人會死掉。

        *👆 在這個狀況下，大多數人選擇 D。負面的 framing 讓人傾向選擇風險。*

5. Availability: We are influenced by information that is most easily available.
    - 有知名投資人因不想受到資訊影響，而特意選擇不知名的公司投資。
    - 每年死於車禍和死於癌症的人數哪個比較多？

        癌症 160,000，車禍 34,000。

        但是大多數人都會選車禍，因為我們最常看見車禍的新聞，戲劇化讓我們印象深刻。

    ** 我們是否因某些資訊取得容易，而判斷錯誤呢？ **

6. Escalation: The most successful negotiators look at negotiations from the perspective of the other side.
    - MBA 的＄20 競標會
        - 最少加＄1，最高出價者得＄20，最高和第二高出價者都要付出價錢
        - 最後競標到＄15,000，第二競標者＄14,500
        - 最高出價者女醫師表示：「我猜教授不會自己留著那些錢，可能會捐掉，所以我就開心地往上喊了。」
        - 第二高出價者創業家表示：「我不喜歡輸。」
    - Competitive Arousal

        Three main causes:

        1. Intense rivalry (especially one-on-one competition)
        2. Time pressure
        3. In the spotlight

        Try to minimize by, for example:

        - Limit the role of someone who is especially intense
        - Manage time better
        - Spread responsibility so that one person not in spotlight

    What separates a good negotiator from a great negotiator is this ability to look at the deal from the other side.

    - 克林頓總統的要求
        - 一位克林頓總統的資深顧問透露，當克林頓在拜訪其他國家的大使時，顧問被要求在半個小時的時間內，提出兩個國家之間的四個主要問題，在那之後他會詢問和思考，對方是怎麼想這些主要問題的。而克林頓總是能很快的理解這些問題，了解對方的觀點，並 reframe 這些問題來讓兩國解決。
    - Teddy Roosevelt's photograph
        - 羅斯福總統印了三百萬份的小冊子，上面有他的照片，準備在巡迴演講時發放
        - 但這張照片的版權在一個照相館老闆手上
        - 如果一份是＄1，總共就是三百萬美金，羅斯福總統沒有錢能付了
        - 他詢問在華爾街的談判高手，該怎麼做？

            我：讓他知道，我們會跟大家說這張好照片是他拍的

            談判高手：”We are planning to distribute millions of pamphlets with Roosevelt's picture on the cover. It will be great publicity for the studio whose photograph we use. How much will you pay us to use yours? Respond immediately.“

    - 我們要出多少價收購公司？
        - 要收購一家石油開發公司，其價值在＄0~100M，每個數字都有可能，對方知道實際價值多少
        - 透過我們團隊的管理，可增加 50％的價值
        - 只能出價一次，我們應該要出多少價錢呢？

            我們應該不買，因為我們在各種狀況下都是賠錢的。

            假設出價＄60M，若實際價值超過＄60M，對方不會答應；若實際價值低於＄60M，平均是＄30，增加 50％ 是＄45M，還是虧了＄15M。

7. Reciprocation: We feel the need to repay what someone has given us.
    - 在談判時雙方有自己在意的點，有時候自己先妥協在對方在意的點上，對方也會想在自己在意的點上妥協。
8. Contrast Principle: Things look different when presented in sequence.
    - 房仲業者會先帶你看兩間比較不好的房子，再帶你去看第三間又貴又好的房子，讓你覺得這是一筆好交易
    - 一封寫給父母的信

        Dear Mom and Dad, it has been three months since I left for college, I'm very sorry for my thoughtlessness in not having written before, I will bring you up to date now, but before you read on, you better sit down, okay?

        I'm getting along pretty well now. The skull fracture and the concussion I got, when I jumped out of my apartment window when it caught fire, shortly after my arrival, is pretty well healed now. I only spend two weeks in the hospital, and now I can see almost normally, and only get those sick headaches once a day.

        Luckily, the fire in my apartment and my jump, were witnessed by Roger, an attendant at a gas station. And he was the one who called the fire department.

        He also visited me in the hospital.

        And since I had nowhere to live, he was kind enough to invite me to share his apartment with him. He's a very fine man, and we are planning to get married. We haven't set the date yet, but it will be before my pregnancy begins to show.

        His divorce is final now, and he shares custody of his three children.

        The reason for the delay in our marriage, is that Roger has a minor infection which presents, prevents us from passing our pre marital blood tests, and I carelessly caught the infection from him. This will soon clear up, with the penicillin injections I am taking daily.

        Now that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you that there was no fire in my apartment. I did not have a concussion or a skull fracture, I was not in the hospital.

        I am not pregnant, I'm not engaged, I do not have syphilis. And there is no divorced man in my life.

        However, I am getting a D in my art class and an F in biology. And I wanted to, you to see those grades in their proper perspective. Your loving daughter, Jane.

9. Big-Picture Perspective: Don't get lost in the details.

    *The Monkey Business Illusion:* 

    [The Monkey Business Illusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGQmdoK_ZfY)

    > "When you negotiate, you need to always keep in mind the big picture of what your client wants to achieve, and always come back to it, to avoid the trap of being lost in the details."

# 📍 Create a Contract

*Freedom of contract: The law gives you a lot of freedom in writing that contract to create your responsibilities and to also create your duties.*

## 🔷 Perspectives on Contract

### 🔶 Global Perspective

- Will my contracts be enforced?

> "A system of contract law and the means to enforce it are fundamental."

### 🔶 Business Perspective

> "Obtaining a contract is the primary goal of a business entity."

### 🔶 Personal Perspective

> "In the world of contracts you as the writer control the script and produce the play."

## 🔷 Sources of Contract Law

✳️ 考量兩個因素：法律系統、合約類型

### 🔶 Types of Legal System

- 可大致分為兩種法律系統
- 不過大部分時間，他們兩個都很類似
1. Common Law
    - Based on precedence
    - Originated on England，所以通常被英國統治過的國家也是這個系統
    - 律師會花時間在尋找過去類似的案子，來給予法律建議
    - 合約通常比較長，因為要考慮到所有的可能性
    - Consideration is necessary.
2. Civil Law
    - Based on code
    - Originated on European continent，所以通常被歐陸國家統治過的國家也是這個系統
    - 律師會花時間在尋找 principles，來給予法律建議
    - 合約通常比較短，因為有 principle 可以參考
    - Consideration is not necessary
- 範例：國家是哪種系統？

    印度：Common Law，巴西：Civil Law，美國、加拿大：Mixed (mostly common law)

### 🔶 Types of contract

1. Real Property

    Common Law vs. Civil Law

2. Services

    Common Law vs. Civil Law

3. Product "Goods"

    **Uniform Laws**: US Uniform Commercial Code; UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods

    *👆 公約在國際交易時常用，不過不一定每個國家都有採用。*

## 🔷 Key Elements in Creating a Contract

### 🔶 Is there an agreement?

✳️ 將談判的內容轉換成合約是要花功夫的。

*Framework Agreement: 一種談判工具，合約的模板*

- *一但完成這個模板，就跨越了談判工具，而成為了一個有效力的合同*
- *若想利用談判工具且不想成為合同，可在合約開頭表明此不等同於 binding contract*
- Examples of Framework Agreements
    - Preprinted Lease or Real Estate Contract
    - Agreement in Principle
    - Memorandum of Agreement
    - ...
- 合約何時成立範例
    - 禮拜一，商店想跟製造商買電視，並要求製造商送到店家
    - 禮拜三，製造商說好，但要店家自己去拿
    - 禮拜五，店家說好
    - 後來電視的市價變低了，店家不想履約，製造商吿店家
    - 合約在何時成立的？

        禮拜五。禮拜三的製造商並不是答應合約，而是提供一個counter offer，代表他拒絕了original offer

- Getty Oil 收購案
    - Pennzoil 想收購 Getty Oil
    - 雙方簽訂了 "Memorandum of Agreement"
    - Texaco 後來也跑來跟 Getty Oil 交涉，並成功簽訂合約收購 Getty Oil
    - Pennzoil 控告 Texaco，因為已簽訂的 "Memorandum of Agreement" 是 binding contract
    - 最後成功勝訴，獲得巨額賠償，Taxaco 宣告破產

### 🔶 Is there consideration?

*consideration (對價): 雙方是否都有所付出*

- Common Law 一定要有 consideration，Civil Law 不用
- 建議永遠都放入 consideration，比較安全
- 捐贈給商學院
    - 學生想捐贈三千萬美元給商學院
    - 學生要求之後有一棟研究中心要以他命名
    - 最後簽訂20年內，每年捐一百五十萬美元給學校
    - 請問若學生在20年內過世，他的子女有義務要繼續付這些錢嗎？

        有的，因為存在 consideration，雙方有所交換。

### 🔶 Is the agreement legal?

✳️ 考量這個合約本身是否合法。

### 🔶 Must the deal be in writing?

![Successful%20Negotiation%20Essential%20Strategies%20and%20Sk%20935fc694db3c41389a940c02f5be67d9/Screen_Shot_2021-03-12_at_5.17.40_PM.png](Successful%20Negotiation%20Essential%20Strategies%20and%20Sk%20935fc694db3c41389a940c02f5be67d9/Screen_Shot_2021-03-12_at_5.17.40_PM.png)

✳️ **In writing**

*Parol Evidence Rule: 當一份合約從口頭上變成書面文件後，這個合約就只受書面文件的限制。*

👆 有些國家不適用，或應用的條件不同，但幾乎所有商業合約，這都是第一個申明的規則

- 搬家到紐約的費用範例
    - 我拿到紐約公司的 offer，對方承諾我會幫我付搬家費用
    - 但在簽合約的時候我忘了加這一條
    - 之後想起來向公司提起時，公司表示現在沒錢沒辦法負擔
    - 請問這時候公司有義務要負擔這些費用嗎？

        不用，根據口頭證據規則，若有書面文件則只受書面文件規範。

    - 假設在簽完合約我發現沒加，透過 email 詢問公司，且公司也說好，此時公司有義務要負擔這些費用嗎？

        不用。根據 consideration，當時我已簽完合約並在該公司工作，對方說會幫我負擔費用，但我沒有付出，故沒有強制力。

✳️ **In oral**

- Oral agreements are enforceable

    👆 *但各國對此都有一些例外，比如房地產，房地產資源稀缺，國家通常都會要求要有紙本才有強制力*

- 實務上，請永遠都把合約寫下來，簡單方便許多，也比較沒有爭議

> 「好記性不如爛筆頭」
"The palest ink is better than the best memory."

✳️ **Express Contract & Implied Contract**

- 寫下來的屬於明示性條款，但有些暗示性條款是受法律保障的
- 了解除明示性條款之外，還有哪些暗示性條款很重要
- 洋芋片拉肚子範例
    - 客人到雜貨店買洋芋片，吃了之後很不舒服，要控告店家
    - 店家和客人都不知道洋芋片壞掉
    - 洋芋片是在期限內被販售出去的
    - 請問店家是否有責任？

        要。因為在法律上，店家售出這包洋芋片，就應該要保證其品質。

## 🔷 Business vs. Legal Objectives in Contracting

### 🔶 Contract Tension

1. Loss Prevention: Legally Perfect Contract
2. Value Creation: Achieve Business Goals

✳️ Traditional Legal Approach: Develop a "Perfect Contract"

- Conventional goal — An agreement is final, binding and enforceable
- 律師會從法官的角度來看合約，如果出錯會發生什麼事
- What's wrong with trying to develop the "Perfect Contract"
    - Length and complexity: 握手之約可能會變成超過四十頁的書面合約
    - Transaction Costs: 要花很多時間跟金錢與律師合作
    - 當問題發生的時候，我們會往合約尋求解決方式，而非使用商業技能來解決，此時問題會變 legalistic
    - 有些文化更注重關係而非合約內容
    - 更著重在負面後果，而非此次合作的正面影響

✳️ Lean Contracting Approach

- 由蘇格蘭的啤酒商律師發跡
- 內容包含：產品或服務的價錢、智慧財產權、隱含的法規（沒有寫上去）
- 有許多法規已被國家 implied，為什麼要多花時間去討論現有的法規呢？
- 更強調市場自由機制而非法律義務，若雙方已沒有互利互惠，就不用硬逼著對方合作

✳️ Conventional vs. Lean

- 如果是一次性的交易（借款、股份交易等等），可以寫得更詳細一點；如果是長期的合作關係，則可以更倚賴雙方的信任，不寫的過分詳細。

✳️ How can we make the legal terms more understandable?

- 法律文件總是讓人看不懂，可以試著視覺化，或是增加一些顏色

# 📍 Perform and Evaluate: The End Game

✳️ Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)

Importance of ADR: 

1. You negotiate ADR contract clauses
2. You participate in ADR processes
3. You act as a third party in resolving work disputes

1/3 的律師不曾建議他們的客戶使用調解或仲裁。其中一個原因是利益，訴訟能賺更多錢。

## 🔷 Dispute Prevention

*Preventive Law: The first principle of preventive law is that it is often more important to predict what people will do than to predict what a court will do... Winning a lawsuit can be ruinous.*

- 預防性法則關注的不是打贏官司，而是人們為什麼要上法院

> "I was ruined twice in my life: once when I lost a lawsuit and once when I won one."
— 伏爾泰

- 萬豪酒店（Marriott）
    - 教授希望櫃檯打電話叫他起床，但當天電話沒有響
    - 教授有設鬧鐘，所以沒有遲到
    - 在填寫意見表的時候，教授提到了這件事
    - 兩週後，教授收到萬豪酒店董事長（J Willard Marriott）的來信。
    「發生這樣的事情讓我很失望，請接受我真誠的道歉。我已經向該酒店反應此問題，要求他們改善。感謝您抽空寫下您的寶貴意見，希望我們有幸再次為您服務，已重獲您的信任。」

## 🔷 ADR Concepts

✳️ 我們不只可在有爭議的時候使用，在交易中也可以使用

1. Mediation — e.g., Mini-trial
    - 代表有機會從對方律師的角度了解這一案件（可能和從自己律師那邊聽到的很不一樣）
    - 他們得以想出一個從商業的角度來看明智的方案
    - Telecredit & TRW 的 mini-trial
        - 雙方因智慧財產權有爭議，且訴訟多年無果，決定自己用商業的方式來解決
        - 有五個人，雙方代表與他們的律師，加上一位中立的智慧產權專家
        - 一方的律師先陳述案件，有問題向專家提問。接著換另一方的律師陳述，向專家提問
        - 雙方代表獨自走進一個房間，半小時後達成協議
2. Arbitration — e.g., Rent-A-Judge
    - 比較快，一般來說訴訟可能都要好幾年才會落幕
    - 比較便宜，對雙方來說
    - 這件事情不會公開（仲裁可以說是私密的訴訟）
    - 可以選擇法官，若走普通的法庭系統我們可能會碰到不熟悉領域的法官
    - 布萊德彼特與珍妮佛的爭議 Rent-A-Judge
        - 租一個退休法官，來幫助達成協議
    - 棒球球員薪水
        - 雙方對薪水有爭議，請了仲裁員來協助
        - 在棒球項目上，他們採用一種獨特的仲裁形式
        - 與其直接讓仲裁員選擇薪水，他們會讓雙方在私下給仲裁員一個數字，而仲裁員必須從兩個裡面挑選一個
        - 這迫使雙方會選擇一個更中間的數字，否則仲裁員會選擇另一個人的數字

            *👆 比如說A要＄22，B要＄13，若私下A給＄20，B給＄13，則仲裁員會選擇＄20的*

## 🔷 ADR Tools

### 🔶 Corporate Pledge

- 公司承諾是一種可以採納為公司政策的承諾
- 其中一個好處是能幫助人們避開心理陷阱 — Reactive devaluation
（我：「公司已採用這個承諾多年，您可以考慮也採納看看。」）

> "In the event of a business dispute between our company and another company which has made or will then make a similar statement, we are prepared to explore with that other party resolution of the dispute through negotiation or ADR techniques before pursuing full-scale litigation."

### 🔶 Screens

- 篩選標準就是一個問題清單，它是為除了律師以外的商界人士設計的，基於回答的答案，去選擇要用有法律效力的還是沒有法律效力的ADR程序（binding: litigation, arbitration）
- 利用這個去選擇用什麼方式解決 dispute resolution

### 🔶 Contract Clauses

- ADR 條款有兩種使用情境：事前跟事後。
- 事前表示在發生爭議前，合約就包含了這些條款
- 事後表示合同中不包含這些條款，等爭端出現時再去想要怎麼解決

✳️ 比如在合約中表明若發生爭議要以哪種方式解決

1. Mediation
2. Arbitration
3. Linked Mediation + Arbitration
4. Linked Negotiation Mediation + Arbitration

### 🔶 Online Dispute Resolution
