# Successful Negotiation: Essential Strategies and Skills

# Plan Your Negotiation Strategy

## Should I negotiate?

- 成本 vs 好處
    - 教授 offer 範例

        大學發給教授offer，教授回信附帶一些條件，結果大學把offer取消了。

## Position Based vs Interest  Based

[Types of Negotiations](https://www.notion.so/ef3a36f953cf44b3834e5bf7657e4dd1)

- 有人認為大部分時候，去尋找 Interest-Based 只是在浪費時間，但教授推薦我們，無論如何，都試著去尋找 bigger pie，創造更多價值。
- 永遠要做好 Position-Based 的準備。
- Pizza 範例

    Position Based：一人一半，一般認為這就是 win-win

    Interest Based：一人喜歡邊邊，另一人喜歡料，雙方可得想要的部分，真正的 win-win

## Six types of dispute resolution & Three lenses

1. Power（武力）
2. litigation（訴訟）
3. arbitration（仲裁）
4. mediation（調解）
5. negotiation（談判）
6. avoidance（迴避）

### Alternative Dispute Resolution（ADR）

Litigation is the enemy! Avoid litigation.

- Arbitration、Mediation、Negotiation

### Third Party Processes

External Third Parties or Third Parties within a Business（External & Internal）

- Litigation、Arbitration、Mediation

### Power Rights Interests

Who's right? Which is finding underlying interests of both parties?

- Power：Power
- Rights：Litigation、Arbitration
- Interests：Mediation、negotiation

### Conclusion

- Search for interests - even in a dispute resolution negotiation
- Understand the six types of dispute resolution and the three lenses
- Consider using dispute resolution processes like mediation and arbitration for deal making

## How should I analyze a negotiation?

1. What questions should I ask to complete an analysis?
2. What is my BATNA in a dispute resolution negotiation?
3. How can I use decision trees to complete my BATNA analysis?

> "If you don't know where you're going, you might end up somewhere else."  
  *——  Yogi Berra*

狀況：

- 我想要賣車，Sarah 是唯一一個回應我的買家
- 我需要賣至少 $4000，因為我要付新車的錢
- 我需要三週後再交車
- 做足功課後，合理價格為 $5000
- 這筆交易至少要賣$4500，不然我就用 $4000 賣給我的朋友，而且他會讓我三週後再交車

### What's the Other Side's Analysis?

- One of the landmarks of successful negotiators. They always look at the deal from the perspective from the other side.

### Key Questions in a Negotiation Analysis

1. What is your overall goal in reaching a negotiated agreement with Sarah?
2. What issues are most important to you in reaching this goal? Why are these issues important?
3. **What is your Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement(BATNA) with Sarah?**
4. What is your reservation price ( in this negotiation with Sarah, the lowest price that you will accept)?
5. What is your most likely price?
6. What is your stretch goal?

### Conclusion

- Setting a large stretch goal can close a great deal but don't be too greedy.
- BATNA
- What's the other side's analysis?
- Where is the ZOPA (Zone of Potential Agreement)?

## BATNA in a Dispute Resolution Negotiation

如果無法自行談判或調解，通常 BATNA 就是 litigation。

### Things about Litigation in US

- Contingency Fees: 
律師抽金額%數。
- Class Actions: 
可以多人聯合控告。
- Discovery: 
1. 律師可以自己去調查公司、個人文件，並呈堂供證。
2. 可以要求對方在法院見證人下發誓作證。
- Jury Trials: 
在民事訴訟也會有，例如商業訴訟。
- Punitive Damages: 
懲罰性賠償，為防止其他人也從事相似事項。且在美國這筆費用會給原告。
- "American Rule" (on attorney fees):
輸家不用付贏家的律師費。
- 要進入美國司法系統是很容易的。
- 車禍例子
    - 車速過快，擦撞後椅子擠壓造成小孩死亡。
    - 父母控告：椅子有問題，沒有警告我們椅子危險，而且要求懲罰性賠償（魯莽行為）。
    - 車商回應：椅子有達到產業標準，而且也超過政府標準。
    - 父母律師 "Discovery" 發現車商早就知道有問題，且一直隱瞞大眾，產品直接上線
    - 最後結果：賠償＋懲罰性賠償

### Conclusion

- If you cannot negotiate the settlement of a dispute either directly or with the help of a mediator, your BATNA might be litigation (or arbitration, which is basically private litigation).
- To analyze your litigation BATNA, especially in a global economy, you should understand the basic elements in the litigation process.

## Using Decision Tree to Complete Your BATNA Analysis

- 範例
    - A控告B，要求 4.6 million，五十趴贏，如果輸了要付400,000
    - B提供 2 million 要和解。

    提問：是否要和解？

    - 解答

### Conclusion

- Decision trees are valuable tools for analyzing your BATNA in both dispute resolution and deal-making negotiations.
- This tool is also useful in making other complex business decisions.

## Cross-Cultural Negotiations

- In cross-cultural negotiations, do a gap analysis to identify how your negotiation style differs from the other side.
- Keep in mind that there are variances within each culture.
- Conduct research so that you can avoid actions that are offensive in the other culture.
- Try role-reversal.
- Success of negotiation between cross-national companies depends on respect of each other rather than style.

## Ethical Issues and Standards

### Law-Based Ethical Standards

- Fraud: False representation of a material fact that is relied on by the other side
- Fiduciary Duty: A high duty of trust and loyalty
- Unconscionability: Violates principles of good conscience

### General Ethical Standards

- Organizational Standards
- Mentor: Someone you admire
- Personal Standards: Gut Test, Newspaper Test, Family Test, Golden Rule

## Use Agent for negotiation or not?

- Is the agent a better negotiator?
- Does the agent have more experience in negotiating the issues?
- Does the negotiation involve a technical matter that requires the expertise of an agent?
- How much time do I have to invest in a negotiation?
- What is my relationship with the other side?

### Reality

- In business, almost all negotiations are conducted through agents.
- Sometimes companies use secret agents since they don't want other side to know who's behind.

    ![Successful%20Negotiation%20Essential%20Strategies%20and%20Sk%20935fc694db3c41389a940c02f5be67d9/Screen_Shot_2021-03-01_at_11.51.51_AM.png](Successful%20Negotiation%20Essential%20Strategies%20and%20Sk%20935fc694db3c41389a940c02f5be67d9/Screen_Shot_2021-03-01_at_11.51.51_AM.png)

    - 華特迪士尼例子
        - 他用迪士尼的名字在 LA 買了 80 acres，結果周圍的地區被其他人買走，他發誓再也不這麼做。
        - 之後他跑到 Florida，設置 dummy cooperation 等等，用 secret agent 買了 2700 acres。

### First question to ask before starting negotiate with an agent

- Agent's Authority
    - Express: authority to negotiate the deal
    - Implied: authority to negotiate certain deal
    - Apparent: company said agent has, but it doesn't
    - 向銀行借錢實例
        - A 向銀行借錢，但他沒有抵押品。
        - A 在大公司上班，他請主管 B 保證公司能還錢，且附上簽名。

        問題：思考銀行是否要借錢？

        - 結果
            - 銀行借了錢，A 卻違約。
            - 銀行向公司討債，但法院判定公司沒有義務要付錢，因沒有授權 B 保證還錢。

> **Do not assume that the other side has full authority just because they are there negotiating with you...** Before starting on any give-and-take, find out about the authority on the other side. It is perfectly legitimate to inquire, "Just how much authority do you have in this particular negotiation?" *—— Getting to Yes*

👆 *Instead of asking other side directly, you should ask the principal.*

### Conclusion

- Use the factor checklist when deciding whether to use an agent during negotiations.
- At the beginning of every negotiation, find out whether your counterpart has authority to make a deal.

# Use Key Tactics for Success

## Getting to Know the Other Side

- Avoid your favorite topic - or else you'll probably talk too much.
- Ask a lot of questions. People love to talk about themselves and often will think you are a great conversationalist if you talk about them...
- Listening is crucial. Dan, a comedian from Manhattan, has learned to summarize what the other person says. ("So you think that..." or "So what you're saying is...") "A conversation can go on indefinitely if you do this" he says.

## Using Power in Negotiations

- **BATNA = Power**
1. 找出對方的 BATNA
    - 要跟對方說自己的 BATNA 嗎？

        看狀況，如果自己的 BATNA 很弱，那就不要讓對方知道；如果很強，那就要讓對方知道。

2. 削弱對方的 BATNA
    - 對方有很強的 BATNA 怎麼辦？如何削弱對方的 BATNA？

        可以強調差異性，強調自己的品質、可靠。

3. 增強自己的 BATNA

    > "You would never do a deal without talking to anyone else. Never."

- Also, forming a coalition is another very powerful form of negotiation.

### Use Psychological Tools to avoid traps

Traps: 

1. Mythical Fixed Pie Assumption: We assume that our interests are in direct conflict with the interests of the other side.
    - *Reactive devaluation - 先入為主的貶低*
    - 範例
        - 教授在課堂上請同學兩兩一組，在十秒內掰手腕，若一方掰到底則得一分，最後看比數分配
        - 大部分同學比數為 2 vs 1、3 vs 3
        - 但有少部分同學的比數為 15 vs 15、20 vs 20
        - 少部分同學了解兩邊的利益並沒有衝突，而選擇合作

    ***** 要注意不要讓自己陷入競爭的思維 ***

2. Anchoring: We anchor on an initial value when estimating the value of uncertain objects.
    - Conventional wisdom: 讓對方先丟出價錢因為我們也不確定真正的價值。
    - Anchoring: 自己先丟出價錢，可產生錨定現象。
    - 到底要不要先提出offer？

        當我們很確定自己的價值的時候，可以先提出來。反之當我們不確定價值時，讓對方先提。

    - 若兩邊都很聰明，都不先提出offer呢？

        可訴諸 information exchange。比如律師在談判時，兩邊會找類似案件的offer，慢慢形成共識。

3. Overconfidence: We are overconfident that our judgements are correct.
    - 相信一件事的好處 vs 過度自信的壞處
        - 創業家的 Overconfidence 常常能提供 vision 來說服員工和投資者，正向思考讓他們看見人們最好的一面，並使他們貢獻自己的力量。
        - 人們因過度自信，而做很多錯誤的決定。比如說股市交易員會頻繁交易，但長遠來看卻是虧錢的；又比如談判時在尋找 ZOPA，因過度自信受到限制，而無法找到共識。
        - **我們應該要根據狀況來判斷自信與否。**
            - Decision making - Realist, Disconfirming Evidence
            - Decision Implementation - Optimist
    - 人很難去專注在 disconfirming evidence，我們都受到 confirming evidence 的吸引。
    - "Many great leaders are the ones who are surrounded by people who challenge their thinking and test their thinking, rather than people who simply agree with whatever the leader proposes."
4. Framing: The way that options are framed cause us to be risk averse (if positive frame) or risk seeking (if negative frame).
    - 描述會影響人的選擇。
    - 若要人付出，人傾向賭賭看，不付出；若要人接受好處，人傾向不賭，選擇保險一點的選項。
    - 診所範例

        有600人等著被治療，有不同方案可以選擇。

        - A方案：200人會被治療。
        - B方案：1/3的機會所有人會被治療，但有2/3的機會所有人沒辦法被治療。

        *👆 在這個狀況下，大多數人選擇 A。正面的 framing 讓人傾向不要風險。*

        - C方案：400人會死掉。
        - D方案：1/3的機會沒有人會死掉，但有2/3的機會所有人會死掉。

        *👆 在這個狀況下，大多數人選擇 D。負面的 framing 讓人傾向選擇風險。*

5. Availability: We are influenced by information that is most easily available.
    - 有知名投資人因不想受到資訊影響，而特意選擇不知名的公司投資。
    - 每年死於車禍和死於癌症的人數哪個比較多？

        癌症 160,000，車禍 34,000。

        但是大多數人都會選車禍，因為我們最常看見車禍的新聞，戲劇化讓我們印象深刻。

    ** 我們是否因某些資訊取得容易，而判斷錯誤呢？ **

6. Escalation: The most successful negotiators look at negotiations from the perspective of the other side.
    - MBA 的＄20 競標會
        - 最少加＄1，最高出價者得＄20，最高和第二高出價者都要付出價錢
        - 最後競標到＄15,000，第二競標者＄14,500
        - 最高出價者女醫師表示：「我猜教授不會自己留著那些錢，可能會捐掉，所以我就開心地往上喊了。」
        - 第二高出價者創業家表示：「我不喜歡輸。」
    - Competitive Arousal

        Three main causes:

        1. Intense rivalry (especially one-on-one competition)
        2. Time pressure
        3. In the spotlight

        Try to minimize by, for example:

        - Limit the role of someone who is especially intense
        - Manage time better
        - Spread responsibility so that one person not in spotlight

    What separates a good negotiator from a great negotiator is this ability to look at the deal from the other side.

    - 克林頓總統的要求
        - 一位克林頓總統的資深顧問透露，當克林頓在拜訪其他國家的大使時，顧問被要求在半個小時的時間內，提出兩個國家之間的四個主要問題，在那之後他會詢問和思考，對方是怎麼想這些主要問題的。而克林頓總是能很快的理解這些問題，了解對方的觀點，並 reframe 這些問題來讓兩國解決。
    - Teddy Roosevelt's photograph
        - 羅斯福總統印了三百萬份的小冊子，上面有他的照片，準備在巡迴演講時發放
        - 但這張照片的版權在一個照相館老闆手上
        - 如果一份是＄1，總共就是三百萬美金，羅斯福總統沒有錢能付了
        - 他詢問在華爾街的談判高手，該怎麼做？

            我：讓他知道，我們會跟大家說這張好照片是他拍的

            談判高手：”We are planning to distribute millions of pamphlets with Roosevelt's picture on the cover. It will be great publicity for the studio whose photograph we use. How much will you pay us to use yours? Respond immediately.“

    - 我們要出多少價收購公司？
        - 要收購一家石油開發公司，其價值在＄0~100M，每個數字都有可能，對方知道實際價值多少
        - 透過我們團隊的管理，可增加 50％的價值
        - 只能出價一次，我們應該要出多少價錢呢？

            我們應該不買，因為我們在各種狀況下都是賠錢的。

            假設出價＄60M，若實際價值超過＄60M，對方不會答應；若實際價值低於＄60M，平均是＄30，增加 50％ 是＄45M，還是虧了＄15M。

7. Reciprocation: We feel the need to repay what someone has given us.
    - 在談判時雙方有自己在意的點，有時候自己先妥協在對方在意的點上，對方也會想在自己在意的點上妥協。
8. Contrast Principle: Things look different when presented in sequence.
    - 房仲業者會先帶你看兩間比較不好的房子，再帶你去看第三間又貴又好的房子，讓你覺得這是一筆好交易。
    - 一封寫給父母的信

        Dear Mom and Dad, it has been three months since I left for college, I'm very sorry for my thoughtlessness in not having written before, I will bring you up to date now, but before you read on, you better sit down, okay?

        I'm getting along pretty well now. The skull fracture and the concussion I got, when I jumped out of my apartment window when it caught fire, shortly after my arrival, is pretty well healed now. I only spend two weeks in the hospital, and now I can see almost normally, and only get those sick headaches once a day.

        Luckily, the fire in my apartment and my jump, were witnessed by Roger, an attendant at a gas station. And he was the one who called the fire department.

        He also visited me in the hospital.

        And since I had nowhere to live, he was kind enough to invite me to share his apartment with him. He's a very fine man, and we are planning to get married. We haven't set the date yet, but it will be before my pregnancy begins to show.

        His divorce is final now, and he shares custody of his three children.

        The reason for the delay in our marriage, is that Roger has a minor infection which presents, prevents us from passing our pre marital blood tests, and I carelessly caught the infection from him. This will soon clear up, with the penicillin injections I am taking daily.

        Now that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you that there was no fire in my apartment. I did not have a concussion or a skull fracture, I was not in the hospital.

        I am not pregnant, I'm not engaged, I do not have syphilis. And there is no divorced man in my life.

        However, I am getting a D in my art class and an F in biology. And I wanted to, you to see those grades in their proper perspective. Your loving daughter, Jane.

9. Big-Picture Perspective: Don't get lost in the details.

    *The Monkey Business Illusion:* 

    [The Monkey Business Illusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGQmdoK_ZfY)

    > "When you negotiate, you need to always keep in mind the big picture of what your client wants to achieve, and always come back to it, to avoid the trap of being lost in the details."
