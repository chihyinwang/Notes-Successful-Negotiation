## Should I negotiate?

- 成本 vs 好處
    - 教授 offer 範例

        大學發給教授offer，教授回信附帶一些條件，結果大學把offer取消了。

## Position Based vs Interest  Based

[Types of Negotiations](https://www.notion.so/ef3a36f953cf44b3834e5bf7657e4dd1)

- 有人認為大部分時候，去尋找 Interest-Based 只是在浪費時間，但教授推薦我們，無論如何，都試著去尋找 bigger pie，創造更多價值。
- 永遠要做好 Position-Based 的準備。
- Pizza 範例

    Position Based：一人一半，一般認為這就是 win-win

    Interest Based：一人喜歡邊邊，另一人喜歡料，雙方可得想要的部分，真正的 win-win

## Six types of dispute resolution & Three lenses

1. Power（武力）
2. litigation（訴訟）
3. arbitration（仲裁）
4. mediation（調解）
5. negotiation（談判）
6. avoidance（迴避）

External Third Parties or Third Parties within a Business（External & Internal）

- Litigation、Arbitration、Mediation

### Power Rights Interests

Who's right? Which is finding underlying interests of both parties?

- Power：Power
- Rights：Litigation、Arbitration
- Interests：Mediation、negotiation

### Conclusion

- Search for interests - even in a dispute resolution negotiation
- Understand the six types of dispute resolution and the three lenses
- Consider using dispute resolution processes like mediation and arbitration for deal making

## How should I analyze a negotiation?

1. What questions should I ask to complete an analysis?
2. What is my BATNA in a dispute resolution negotiation?
3. How can I use decision trees to complete my BATNA analysis?

> "If you don't know where you're going, you might end up somewhere else."  
  *——  Yogi Berra*

狀況：

- 我想要賣車，Sarah 是唯一一個回應我的買家
- 我需要賣至少 $4000，因為我要付新車的錢
- 我需要三週後再交車
- 做足功課後，合理價格為 $5000
- 這筆交易至少要賣$4500，不然我就用 $4000 賣給我的朋友，而且他會讓我三週後再交車

### What's the Other Side's Analysis?

- One of the landmarks of successful negotiators. They always look at the deal from the perspective from the other side.

### Key Questions in a Negotiation Analysis

1. What is your overall goal in reaching a negotiated agreement with Sarah?
2. What issues are most important to you in reaching this goal? Why are these issues important?
3. **What is your Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement(BATNA) with Sarah?**
4. What is your reservation price ( in this negotiation with Sarah, the lowest price that you will accept)?
5. What is your most likely price?
6. What is your stretch goal?

### Conclusion

- Setting a large stretch goal can close a great deal but don't be too greedy.
- BATNA
- What's the other side's analysis?
- Where is the ZOPA (Zone of Potential Agreement)?

## BATNA in a Dispute Resolution Negotiation

如果無法自行談判或調解，通常 BATNA 就是 litigation。

### Things about Litigation in US

- Contingency Fees: 
律師抽金額%數。
- Class Actions: 
可以多人聯合控告。
- Discovery: 
1. 律師可以自己去調查公司、個人文件，並呈堂供證。
2. 可以要求對方在法院見證人下發誓作證。
- Jury Trials: 
在民事訴訟也會有，例如商業訴訟。
- Punitive Damages: 
懲罰性賠償，為防止其他人也從事相似事項。且在美國這筆費用會給原告。
- "American Rule" (on attorney fees):
輸家不用付贏家的律師費。
- 要進入美國司法系統是很容易的。
- 車禍例子
    - 車速過快，擦撞後椅子擠壓造成小孩死亡。
    - 父母控告：椅子有問題，沒有警告我們椅子危險，而且要求懲罰性賠償（魯莽行為）。
    - 車商回應：椅子有達到產業標準，而且也超過政府標準。
    - 父母律師 "Discovery" 發現車商早就知道有問題，且一直隱瞞大眾，產品直接上線
    - 最後結果：賠償＋懲罰性賠償

### Conclusion

- If you cannot negotiate the settlement of a dispute either directly or with the help of a mediator, your BATNA might be litigation (or arbitration, which is basically private litigation).
- To analyze your litigation BATNA, especially in a global economy, you should understand the basic elements in the litigation process.

## Using Decision Tree to Complete Your BATNA Analysis

- 範例
    - A控告B，要求 4.6 million，五十趴贏，如果輸了要付400,000
    - B提供 2 million 要和解。

    提問：是否要和解？

### Conclusion

- Decision trees are valuable tools for analyzing your BATNA in both dispute resolution and deal-making negotiations.
- This tool is also useful in making other complex business decisions.

## Cross-Cultural Negotiations

- In cross-cultural negotiations, do a gap analysis to identify how your negotiation style differs from the other side.
- Keep in mind that there are variances within each culture.
- Conduct research so that you can avoid actions that are offensive in the other culture.
- Try role-reversal.
- Success of negotiation between cross-national companies depends on respect of each other rather than style.

## Ethical Issues and Standards

### Law-Based Ethical Standards

- Fraud: False representation of a material fact that is relied on by the other side
- Fiduciary Duty: A high duty of trust and loyalty
- Unconscionability: Violates principles of good conscience

### General Ethical Standards

- Organizational Standards
- Mentor: Someone you admire
- Personal Standards: Gut Test, Newspaper Test, Family Test, Golden Rule

## Use Agent for negotiation or not?

- Is the agent a better negotiator?
- Does the agent have more experience in negotiating the issues
- Does the negotiation involve a technical matter that requires the expertise of an agent?
- How much time do I have to invest in a negotiation?
- What is my relationship with the other side?

### Reality

- In business, almost all negotiations are conducted through agents.
- Sometimes companies use secret agents since they don't want other side to know who's behind.

    - 華特迪士尼例子
        - 他用迪士尼的名字在 LA 買了 80 acres，結果周圍的地區被其他人買走，他發誓再也不這麼做。
        - 之後他跑到 Florida，設置 dummy cooperation 等等，用 secret agent 買了 2700 acres。

### First question to ask before starting negotiate with an agent

- Agent's Authority
    - Express: authority to negotiate the deal
    - Implied: authority to negotiate certain deal
    - Apparent: company said agent has, but it doesn't
    - 向銀行借錢實例
        - A 向銀行借錢，但他沒有抵押品。
        - A 在大公司上班，他請主管 B 保證公司能還錢，且附上簽名。

        問題：思考銀行是否要借錢？

        - 結果
            - 銀行借了錢，A 卻違約。
            - 銀行向公司討債，但法院判定公司沒有義務要付錢，因沒有授權 B 保證還錢。

> **Do not assume that the other side has full authority just because they are there negotiating with you...** Before starting on any give-and-take, find out about the authority on the other side. It is perfectly legitimate to inquire, "Just how much authority do you have in this particular negotiation?" *—— Getting to Yes*

👆 *Instead of asking other side directly, you should ask the principal.*

### Conclusion

- Use the factor checklist when deciding whether to use an agent during negotiations.
- At the beginning of every negotiation, find out whether your counterpart has authority to make a deal.

# Use Key Tactics for Success

## Getting to Know the Other Side

- Avoid your favorite topic - or else you'll probably talk too much.
- Ask a lot of questions. People love to talk about themselves and often will think you are a great conversationalist if you talk about them...
- Listening is crucial. Dan, a comedian from Manhattan, has learned to summarize what the other person says. ("So you think that..." or "So what you're saying is...") "A conversation can go on indefinitely if you do this" he says.

## Using Power in Negotiations

- **BATNA = Power**
1. 找出對方的 BATNA
    - 要跟對方說自己的 BATNA 嗎？

        看狀況，如果自己的 BATNA 很弱，那就不要讓對方知道；如果很強，那就要讓對方知道。

2. 削弱對方的 BATNA
    - 對方有很強的 BATNA 怎麼辦？如何削弱對方的 BATNA？

        可以強調差異性，強調自己的品質、可靠。

3. 增強自己的 BATNA

    > You would never do a deal without talking to anyone else. Never.

- Also, forming a coalition is another very powerful form of negotiation.

### Use Psychological Tools to avoid traps

Traps: 

1. Mythical Fixed Pie Assumption: We assume that our interests are in direct conflict with the interests of the other side.
    - *Reactive devaluation - 先入為主的貶低*
    - 範例
        - 教授在課堂上請同學兩兩一組，在十秒內掰手腕，若一方掰到底則得一分，最後看比數分配
        - 大部分同學比數為 2 vs 1、3 vs 3
        - 但有少部分同學的比數為 15 vs 15、20 vs 20
        - 少部分同學了解兩邊的利益並沒有衝突，而選擇合作

    ***** 要注意不要讓自己陷入競爭的思維 ***

2. Anchoring: We anchor on an initial value when estimating the value of uncertain objects.
    - Conventional wisdom: 讓對方先丟出價錢因為我們也不確定真正的價值。
    - Anchoring: 自己先丟出價錢，可產生錨定現象。
    - 到底要不要先提出offer？

        當我們很確定自己的價值的時候，可以先提出來。反之當我們不確定價值時，讓對方先提。

    - 若兩邊都很聰明，都不先提出offer呢？

        可訴諸 information exchange。比如律師在談判時，兩邊會找類似案件的offer，慢慢形成共識。

3. Overconfidence: We are overconfident that our judgements are correct.
    - 相信一件事的好處 vs 過度自信的壞處
        - 創業家的 Overconfidence 常常能提供 vision 來說服員工和投資者，正向思考讓他們看見人們最好的一面，並使他們貢獻自己的力量。
        - 人們因過度自信，而做很多錯誤的決定。比如說股市交易員會頻繁交易，但長遠來看卻是虧錢的；又比如談判時在尋找 ZOPA，因過度自信受到限制，而無法找到共識。
        - **我們應該要根據狀況來判斷自信與否。**
            - Decision making - Realist, Disconfirming Evidence
            - Decision Implementation - Optimist
    - 人很難去專注在 disconfirming evidence，我們都受到 confirming evidence 的吸引。
    - "Many great leaders are the ones who are surrounded by people who challenge their thinking and test their thinking, rather than people who simply agree with whatever the leader proposes."
4. Framing: The way that options are framed cause us to be risk averse (if positive frame) or risk seeking (if negative frame).
    - 描述會影響人的選擇。
    - 若要人付出，人傾向賭賭看，不付出；若要人接受好處，人傾向不賭，選擇保險一點的選項。
    - 診所範例

        有600人等著被治療，有不同方案可以選擇。

        - A方案：200人會被治療。
        - B方案：1/3的機會所有人會被治療，但有2/3的機會所有人沒辦法被治療。

        *👆 在這個狀況下，大多數人選擇 A。正面的 framing 讓人傾向不要風險。*

        - C方案：400人會死掉。
        - D方案：1/3的機會沒有人會死掉，但有2/3的機會所有人會死掉。

        *👆 在這個狀況下，大多數人選擇 D。負面的 framing 讓人傾向選擇風險。*
